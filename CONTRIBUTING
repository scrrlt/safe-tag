# Contributing

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch with `git checkout -b feature/<short-description>`.

3. Keep changes focused; split unrelated updates into separate branches.

## Development workflow
- Write or update tests alongside your code changes.
- Run the project linters and test suite before committing.

- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive, explaining the reason for the change.
- Avoid committing generated files or build artifacts.

## Pull requests
