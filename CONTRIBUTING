# Contributing

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch with `git checkout -b feature/<short-description>`.
2. Install required dependencies as described in the project README.
3. Keep changes focused; split unrelated updates into separate branches.

## Reporting edge cases and performance issues
- If you find a value that causes `safeTag` to return an unexpected tag (or regress in performance), please include a **minimal repro**.
- If the input is "hostile" (revoked proxy, throwing getter, cross-realm value), describe exactly how it is constructed.
- Include environment details:
  - Node.js version
  - OS
  - Package version / commit SHA
- For performance reports, include benchmark output from `npm run bench` and describe your workload (value shapes, call volume, whether inputs are trusted).

## Development workflow
- Write or update tests alongside your code changes.
- Run the project linters and test suite before committing.
- Ensure documentation reflects any new or changed behavior.

## Commit guidelines
- Follow the `type(scope): summary` convention when possible (for example, `feat(parser): add new tag sanitizer`).
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive, explaining the reason for the change.
- Avoid committing generated files or build artifacts.

## Pull requests
- Rebase your branch onto the latest main branch before submitting a pull request.
- Provide a clear summary of the change and list any notable impacts or required follow-up work.
- Request reviews from relevant maintainers and address feedback promptly.

## Code of conduct
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
- Report any issues or concerns through the channels documented in the repository.
